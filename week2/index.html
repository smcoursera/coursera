    I chose an eternity of this
	Like falling angels
	The world disappeared
	Laughing into the fire
	Is it always like this?...

    but i never said i would stay to the end so i
	leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
	screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
	screaming me over and over and over i leave

    There's a thin white cold new moon and the snow is coming down
	And the neon bright tokyo lights flicker through the crowd
	I've been drifting around for hours and I'm lost and I'm tired
